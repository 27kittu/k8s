ConfigMaps:
------------

IMPORTANT:
----------
- By default, Kubernetes mounts ConfigMaps as read-only preventing  changes, like setting executable permissions, directly within the mounted location 

- Config maps are used to save non-confidential data in the form of key-value pairs or normal scripts to run on machines

- Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.
