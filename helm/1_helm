helm: 
-----
- is a package manager for k8s to download,version control and install packages with multiple dependent or independent manifest files
- helm simplifies installing an entire application with multiple manifest files using a single helm chart
-----------------------------------
Helm 2 VS Helm 3:
-------------------
Helm 3:
-------
- Helm 3 involves with Helm client+helm local repo, helm chart Repo(hub)  and the kubernetes cluster where helm installs apps 
- If there are helm charts available, helm installs apps into cluster directly from hub


Helm 2:
--------
- Helm 2 involves with Helm client+local repo, tiller and k8s cluster
- Helm 2 cannot interact with k8s cluster but has a Helm software component 'tiller' which is installed and internally contacts k8s cluster
- TIller is a component in K8s cluster and the tiller will install any apps in k8s cluster

-----------------------------------
helm chart:
-----------
- A Chart is a Helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions
- A Repository is the place where charts can be collected and shared. Repository can be 'local repo' or a remote one too
- A Release is an instance of a chart. One chart can be installed many times and each time it is installed creates a new release.
- when you create a helm chart with name 'app1' using the below comand

helm create app1


we get contents as below

app1
-----------

controlplane $ ls -R app1/
app1/:
Chart.yaml  prodvalues.yaml  templates  values.yaml

app1/templates:
NOTES.txt  _helpers.tpl  deployment.yaml  hpa.yaml  ingress.yaml  service.yaml  serviceaccount.yaml  tests

app1/templates/tests:
test-connection.yaml

-------------
default files are:
-------------------

charts/       :   Contains any charts on which the current chart depends
templates/    :   Contains manifest files which use values.yaml    
Chart.yaml    :   Has metadata of helm chart like name, apiVersion, desc.,
values.yaml   :   Has the default values  to be passed to the chart 

Optional files are:
--------------------

crds/         : custom resource definitions applied to support above charts
LICENSE       : A plain text file containing the license for the chart
README.md     : A human-readable README file


===================================
HELM TEMPLATING LANGUAGE:
