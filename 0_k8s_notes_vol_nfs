- Create an NFS server that can be used for 'StorageClass' to create volumes

- First, install a few packages in NFS server

'sudo apt install -y'
'sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y'

- configure 'NFS share directory' or 'NFS export directory'
'sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share'

- Now configuring the folder and file level privileges
'sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/nfs_share'
'sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/nfs_share'

- Now, we have to configure permissions to access the share to file-system to the clients in '/etc/exports'
'vim /etc/exports'

in the above file, we can give permissions to the servers who are permitted to use the file system by mentioning the details

/mnt/share <ip_address-of -client either range/ip_address/public/private/*>(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)

mention above and save.

- Now restart the after exporting the changes
'sudo exportfs -a'

- restart the process 'nfs'
'sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server'


- In client server, we have to install other packages

'sudo apt install nfs-common -y'

- After installation, check if nfs-server  connects /mnt

'sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4.1 172.30.2.2:/mnt/nfsvol /mnt'

- From the client machine, try to view the exports available on the server:

'showmount -e 172.30.2.2'
