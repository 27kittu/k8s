Service Accounts:
------------------
- Service accounts are non-human accounts to provide access to various k8s objects like pods, system components, inside and outside of the cluster.
- These accounts are namespaced and each namespace will be created with a 'service account' named 'default' because whatever objects created in that particular namespace has to get information from API server

- If you delete that service account 'default', API server will again create the same service account 

Uses of service Accounts:
-------------------------
- Every pod or k8s object has to communicate with API server like 'read-only access to sensitive info stored in secrets
- Granting cross-namespace access like allowing a Pod one namespace to read, list, and watch for objects in another namespace.
- Your Pods need to communicate with an external service like a Pod requires an identity for a commercially available cloud API, and the commercial provider allows configuring a suitable trust relationship.
