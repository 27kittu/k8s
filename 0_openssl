Openssl: cryptographic utility                                          
----------------------------- 
- Generate certificates, hashes                                                           
- Encrype documents and files  
                               
Installation:
---------------    
- Goto 'openssl.org' website and download new version using 'wget'    
- unpack using 'tar -xvzf <file> -C <spec_DIR>'      
- run file './config'. It configures OS and creates 'makefile'      
- Run 'make' file (runs each file at-a-time) or using 'make -j' inorder to use all the cores  
- Run 'sudo make install' to install  
                              
pillars of Cryptography:     
- integrity: using 'sha1sum' tool, data can be checked if it is modified or not
- confidentiality: secret keys       
- authentication                
- authorization                 
- non-repetition            

There are two types of encryptions
Symmetric encryption
Asymmetric encryption

Symmetric encryption: Here only one key used for encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric encryption: There are two keys. one is a 'Public key' which is used for encrypting data and a 'Private key' is used for decrypting data. But, we can generate 'n' number of private keys inorder to decrypt data for many users with only one public key fixed.
Usage:                    
---------                
- To know all the options in 'openssl version'

opensssl version --help  

- To know all the 'standard' commands            

openssl help       
 
- To create 'sha256' of any file, first create any file 

openssl sha256 -hex -out file.sha256 file


Generatin symmetric/secret keys:
----------------------
- To generate secret/symmetric keys
openssl rand -hex 10

hex - hex format
10 - 10 bytes of randomly generated data


- To ouput data to a file

openssl rand -hex -out enkrypt.key 32

32 - size of data
out - output to a file

the key generated can be used for any encrypting of data

- To open an rsa asymmetric/private key

openssl genrsa 

- To mention key size

openssl genrsa 2048

- To create output file

openssl genrsa -out key.pri 2048
