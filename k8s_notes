K8s Storage:
---------------
Volumes:
--------
- Pods use storages are ephemeral means storage lasts for only till pod lasts.
- After we upgrade the pods,volumes are deleted and no data can be recovered(is loss of data)
- VOLUMES are a directory which is accessible to containers in a pod. this can be overcome uisng Persistent Volumes.

PersistentVolumes:
-------------------
- To overcome the above storage limitation, we use Persistent volumes 
- These volumes exist in the cluster even if the pods are deleted.
- we can use any types of storage as a 'Normal Volumes' or even as 'PersistentVolumes'
- Below are the plugins we can use to create and access the volumes


CSI plugins:
------------
- Azure File CSI migration
- CephFS CSI storage driver
- 

ConfigMap:
----------
- ConfigMap is used to reference data in to pods as a 'configMap' type as a volume

emptyDir:
---------
- EmptyDir is a common volume that is shared among the containers in a pod. 
- This volume is created when the pod is assigned to a node
- This volume is deleted if the pod is removed from the node
- Container crashed does not remove the emptydir
- we can control emptyDir size by attributing(sizeLimit: 500Mi)

hostPath:
---------
- A hostpath volume mounts a file or directory from the host's filesystem


NFS:
----
- In order to installuse the NFS volumes, we have to install packages in both the NFS host  and client(k8s) servers
- In NFS host, we have to install 'nfs-kernel-server' and in client(k8s) server, install 'nfs-common' package
- to use with the pods to use the storages
