K8s Storage:
---------------
Volumes:
--------
- K8s storage consists of Volumes
- container storage is ephemeral. If it crashes, containers are freshly started
- To save the files generated by the containers, we have to use storage outside containers
- VOLUMES are a directory which is accessible to containers in a pod.






CSI plugins:
------------
- Azure File CSI migration
- CephFS CSI storage driver
- 

ConfigMap:
----------
- ConfigMap is used to reference data in to pods as a 'configMap' type as a volume

emptyDir:
---------
- EmptyDir is a common volume that is shared among the containers in a pod. 
- This volume is created when the pod is assigned to a node
- This volume is deleted if the pod is removed from the node
- Container crashed does not remove the emptydir
- we can control emptyDir size by attributing(sizeLimit: 500Mi)

hostPath:
---------
- A hostpath volume mounts a file or directory from the host's filesystem
